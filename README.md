Tic Tac: A Tic Tac Toe Game

by Katherine Wiykovics

Hello there, started this project as a way to practice my Flutter skills and demostrate what I can do when left to my own devices. 
It's still a work in progress so forgive any dust.

Current Features:

Two person tic tac toe game.

Compatible with landscape or portrait game style.

Sprays confetti when you win!

Future Features:

Single player mode with a basic AI.

Multiple AI types (once I get one working, I will make more difficult and aggressive AI).

Themes (at least a dark mode and a color blind mode)!

Confetti Xs and Os (had to drop this because it was taking too much time, but once all the other features are working, I will try again).


If you have any other questions about the project or want to know why I did something, please let me know: katherinewiykovics@gmail.com
