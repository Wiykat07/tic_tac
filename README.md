Tic Tac: A Tic Tac Toe Game

by Katherine Wiykovics

Hello there, started this project as a way to practice my Flutter skills and demostrate what I can do when left to my own devices. 
It's still a work in progress so forgive any dust.

Current Features:

Two person tic tac toe game.

Compatible with landscape or portrait game style.

Sprays confetti when you win!

Single player mode with multiple types of AI

Three seperate themes with more as requested

Future Features:

*Single player mode with a basic AI.* DONE AS OF 3/10/2023

*Multiple AI types (once I get one working, I will make more difficult and aggressive AI).* DONE AS OF 3/18/2023

*Themes (at least a dark mode and a color blind mode)!* DONE AS OF 3/18/2023

Custom color: Make a theme that allows the user to pick the colors.

Emoji mode: Make a couple of themes that use emojis as pieces.

Confetti Xs and Os (had to drop this because it was taking too much time, may eventually come back to it).
